# Mabinogi Stat Calculator
This is an application intended to roughly simulate a character's stat values (their damage, defense values, etc.). 
Stat inputs are taken from a character's modified primary stats (yellow-colored values pertaining to HP, MP, Stamina, Str, etc.) and fed through calculations.
The results are roughly accurate minus a plethora of different modifiers.

This is currently a work in progress and a personal learning experience in C#, WPF, and XAML. 
I am making an attempt to follow the MVVM pattern, but pardon me if many things in general are incorrect.
